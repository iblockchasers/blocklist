# Block Together chaser blocklist
A crowdsourced [Block Together](https://blocktogether.org/) blocklist of [trans chasers](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/10/02/trans_chasers_exploitive_admirers_who_harass_trans_people.html) on Twitter.

## Subscribing to the list
Visit https://blocktogether.org/show-blocks/tlTCuoYGFBBI8dE9vkJT1f8QetIGmcsXd0qtzb-I to subscribe - please note, that when you subscribe to a [shared blocklist](https://blocktogether.org/#sharing-block-list) you
>"will block every account currently on that list. Later, if the author of that block list blocks more accounts, you will automatically block those as well. If the author of the list unblocks an account, you will automatically unblock it too, but only if you originally blocked it through the shared list. If you blocked the account independently, it will not be unblocked."
